                Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
                And sorry I could not travel both <br>
                And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
                And looked down one as far as I could <br>
                To where it bent in the undergrowth;
            </p>
            <p>
                Then took the other, as just as fair, <br>
                And having perhaps the better claim, <br>
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br>
                Though as for that the passing there <br>
                Had worn them really about the same,
            </p>
            <p>
                And both that morning equally lay <br>
                In leaves no step had trodden black. <br>
                Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br>
                Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br>
                I doubted if I should ever come back.
            </p>
            <p>
                I shall be telling this with a sigh <br>
                Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>
                Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” <br>
                I took the one less traveled by, <br>
                And that has made all the difference.
